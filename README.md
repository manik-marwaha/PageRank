# PageRank

THIS ALGORITHM WAS IMPLEMENTED AS A PART OF COURSEWORK EXERCISE FOR MINING BIG DATA SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE

1.  Implement the PageRank Algorithm as discussed in Section 5.1 and 5.2(Leskovec, Rajaraman and Ullman) in JAVA, Python or C++.  Your im-plementation  should  make  use  of  the  improvements  regarding  efficiencyand the methods of dealing with dead-ends and spider traps. 

2.  Run your algorithm on the Google Web Graph 2002 available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.htmland provide a file listing the PageRank for each node.  Report separately,the ordered list of the ten nodes having the largest PageRankYour approach should be efficient as possible in terms of runtime and memoryrequirements.
